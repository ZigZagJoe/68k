   to the 68008 reading the initial SP and PC from addresses 0 and 4. As the 
   initial PC will always be located in flash, a read using address line 19
   will always be generated, and thus will suffice as a trigger for setting 
   the BOOTED flag, until the next external reset by the TL7705.   */

   be expanded to support a second exclusive interrupt like this, just take A3
   as an input for IRQ5_IACK and connect its /IRQ to IPL0/2 - irq 5 when asserted */
